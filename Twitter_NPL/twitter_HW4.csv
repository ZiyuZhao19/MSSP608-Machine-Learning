justin bieber,man tomorrow if my parents surprise me with justin bieber tickets I'll have a heart attack
kane,2nd season epl syndrome would have been worse on kane if he left spurs. Let him suffer it there then improve later
kane,"@Aviator973 @ByTimGraham Agree with 1st point, and I can't stand Kane or Blackhaws. I detest slander."
kane,"@AxAs23 it's pretty sad, Rooney may be the last one for a long time now unless players like sterling, Kane, stones, Wilson"
kane,"@Callum_Kimber_C I don't know if I want to see a 3rd, I definitely don't want to see Kane"
kane,@Holtarna @BrentZBradshaw @SaveUsY2Jake Big Show and Kane have zero business finishing 3rd and 4th in the Rumble.
kane,"@Nick422 who hears that Kane may have sexually assaulted someone and thinks ""I should call Chicago and see if he's available""? ugh"
kane,"@PuckinHostile @GradHawksBlog @ChiSox_History as sick as it may sound, I hope Kane gets the indefinite suspension and Hawks get cap relief"
kane,"@SebSB @SBerahino I really hope he stays now, Even if Kane dies of exhaustion by November"
kane,"@WinslowHorne @broach93 1. Agree, that dude is fast. 2. Wat. 3. Friday's. 4. Should've sold Kane when he was worth anything"
kane,@_socoamaretto If Kane doesn't find his Nov-Mar form again I think they could be in for a very bad season. Dier-Mason is the kind of...
kane,"@guyfarmer1978 lol, true. The other striker you do have were trying to take off your hands by Tuesday, lol!! Kane has lost his confidence!"
kane,"@ironviews Good article, and good point about Sakho. He could be sat here now in the same situation as Kane, with people starting to doubt."
kane,"Didn't it take Kane until, like, November to score his first PL goal last season?"
kane,"Hawks might have had decision made for them. With Kane case going before grand jury, no way he can be in camp on the 17th, IMO. #NHL"
kane,I am hearing a settlement may be in the works with Kane and alleged victim. He might be pulling a Kobe - WHICH MEANS HE IS GUILTY!!
kane,I've been thinking about it... Does anyone else find it disturbing how Kane may face rape charges and GM's are calling on his availability?
kane,Kane might just be going thru that 2nd season syndrome
kane,"No way Kane comes here, it's where he gets in trouble the most. Would be kicked out of the NHL by his 30th bday for summer incidents"
kane,"Spurs may aswell make use of adebayor,there paying him millions and there guna need someone when they realise Kane is a one season wonder"
kane,"Toews backing Kane &amp; Voynov arrested by Immigration in US. Oh, tomorrow is going to be an icky NHL news/comment day."
kane,"Would never vote for Kane for president, mostly with Kim Kardashian as his wife. No way in hell is she going to be the 1st lady"
kane,"and FYI, I never had a HUGE problem with Kane; I just don't have respect for anyone who may of raped someone."
kane,@KingOBlackheath Kane and Rooney last night.....may have been the ugliest strike partnership of all time. Horrifying
kane,Kane may have raped a woman &amp; the 1st thought teams have is about trading for him? Fucked up. http://t.co/4mB4QYQKKU http://t.co/i1uXbk36y7
kane,"Okay so the White Sox suck, Rose and Kane may be sexual predators, and Cobb and Nelson are hurt before game one. Sports suck."
kane,#ENG under investigation after fielding 12 players in the 2nd half. Turns out Kane's mate joined him on the pitch http://t.co/eMb3LHBPao
kane,",.EXCLUSIVE.United targeting Anderson and Kane on deadline day but Sources reveal united may not risk flashing out big deals on deadline"
kane,".@schicflair Stardust as Gollum, Undertaker as Sauron, Kane as the Witch King, the Ascension as Uruk Hai, Wyatts as the Ring Wraiths  c'mon."
kane,"//Screw this, if Kane doesn't return tomorrow, he'll be back in the fall."
kane,"1st Giroud, now Kane, lol what a funny day #TOTEVE #Spurs #Everton"
kane,5 teams contact the Blackhawks about Kane... they dont seem to care they may lose him if he's charged ... winning that important to teams?
kane,@AaronTHFC he will have to obviously otherwise just Kane for season. January won't be anybody for sale. Clubs don't need to sell.
kane,"@AdamOsper @tonyfowler4  Yes, I'm optimistic but feel we really needed a 2nd striker who could either play alone or link with Kane"
kane,@AdamOsper think you're mad. 6th is only possible if Kane repeats last years feat which is next to impossible
kane,@AndrewGreif Concern's having 5th guy who can play CB; Kane's natural Safety but he played some CB in camp unless others like Tyree will 2/2
kane,@Atomic_Moog @nick_elt @djc8008 swapping Kane for Giroud week 4. Hazard is a waste of coin as well so he may go next &amp; bring in Yaya or Kun
kane,"@BBCMOTD Kane should stop chasing da' goal, stay calm goals will come automatic, may be he'll get a hatick next game who knows"
kane,"@BenSonicz Yea,i still rmmbr what Kane said, word for word,he was on stage he said 'AUSTIN,THIS SUNDAY THE BLOOD ON YOU WILL BE FOR REAL"""
kane,@BenjButton87 @scullytony @Poblfc @johns3boys @IBRWT just hearing Kane scored for England off to Spain tomorrow it's great to be alive#dubs
kane,@BespokeDave MENTAL. The goals will be 2nd half when the subs come on. Kane will bag a couple I reckon.
kane,@Bull_Diggy @WestHamMatters Toxic deserve 16th place and a season of turmoil in the boardroom plus Kane's struggles on the pitch #happydays
kane,@CobesME4 we'll see when he scores the winner against you and is off to Man Utd with Kane in January. Enjoy Adebyor x
kane,@Corrienationstr dunno. Ibra may not leave. Hes almost 34. Kane mayb but he looks off. Eithier a one season wonder or his head is turned
kane,@Corrienationstr kane is a better then rooney with back to goal. rooney better sat just off
kane,@EddyDavis19 and yeah I agree berahino may go on to be massive but with Kane at the club I'd focus on devolving him even more!
kane,"@EricWSoccer Yeah. In the case of England, when (I live in hope) they have Rooney, Sturridge, Kane and Welbeck fit they may be forced to"
kane,@GaffneyVLC Use Ade in Europa and Cups and let his contract run down. Best way to do it. Save Kane for league and get Berahino as 2nd ST
kane,@Gentleman_THFC Bang him up front with Kane and play Sun and N'Jie on the wings then surely!
kane,@GrimsToyShow grim did you know that Kane will return on Monday night raw
kane,@HannahEckardt This is like my 3rd msg about this but im dumb. Do you know kane's # anymore? i lost it. Also hope everythings good and stuff
kane,"@Hostile_Derek @2ndCityHockey I don't know enough to say for sure, but he may make us not miss saad (if Kane isn't in prison)"
kane,@Iam_Stonewall I'm sure it's going to be Sting. Expecting a Brothers of Destruction reunion too Sunday with Kane helping Taker in his match.
kane,@IdMjones Jesus. I CREATED? I said Kane may not reach the same heights. You then sent me 3 tweets asking my views on Martial in an attempt
kane,@ImperialDesi Hawks will discipline Kane for sure. But he'll play again for the Hawks. May just have to wait a bit
kane,"@JGoldLabel Doubt it. Rumor has it Kane may attack Lesnae because Lesnar ""Put him out"" Sting shows up sets up Taker vs Sting Mania 32"
kane,@JJPhyall @realBenReid I wouldn't be surprised with kane with sting possibly tomorrow
kane,@JW_Burton Kane should of scored and would of made it easy then. Still hope always the important goal is the 1st mate. plenty of time
kane,@Jason_Aldean  Kane just had his 6th heart surgery 4 wks ago-now he's home jamming! http://t.co/pfdzlQOx3R http://t.co/oyazi8VUdl
kane,@JayAndreas @AnglesOfSupport @Sebby_Williams @CoachCKane I can call the lady cause Kane won't turn up till Thursday
kane,"@Kaneshow oh no Kane are you getting a divorce? I just listened to the replay of Tuesday's show and you said ""bc of the divorce"" WHHHAAAT?"
kane,"@Keith_Russell @bensmith130 Both young, talented with potential. Kane's 1st season was ace, struggled since. Martial still raw.risks in both"
kane,"@Keith_Russell Kane. Still remember the deadline day swoop for Berba. Something similar to happen on Tuesday, maybe?"
kane,@LeeCater94 he's a has been. One season wonder like Kane. He'll be gone come the end of the season when Chelsea finish 6th again.
kane,"@Lord_Sugar he will see him only to sign a cheque for me Pogba and Stones!.......careful, we may come for Kane as well"
kane,"@LukeBBurgess not true. Kanes sitter, mason had 2 great chances and kane had another in the 2nd!"
kane,@MBTA happened a few minutes ago.. I believe the bus route was 49... If he went into other Kane's he may have hit firefighters
kane,@MUFC_Hub buys and will make it easier for Kane to get goals not Top 4 contenders for me but 6th
kane,@Mellealaw @ScottLevinWGRZ @sportsmockery @WGRZ Maybe she did.  She may not like being blamed for the accuser going to Kane's house.
kane,@MoreMorley @sonyakennedy yeah but then again Kane has respect for Abby and still butts heads with her so it may happen
kane,@MrsimonWilson1 Will text you the changes tomorrow who do you want to change Kane will check on Bertrand fitness
kane,@Potters_1863 @APB1979 I definitely watch a different game than you. England 2nd best 1st half and not that good 2nd half Kane is difference
kane,"@RedPawRelief Kane, a dog in your care back in July, was found loose today in G-town. Can you help us locate the owner?"
kane,"@RenoWallabout @juicysushi @Inverted_FB @BenoitsSmartCar Chadli as a back up/3rd striker is not the worst thing to have. To replace Kane, no"
kane,@Ryan_Davis17 May not have been just find it strange... That's all. I just hope the same protection that came to Kane doesn't come to Rose.
kane,@Shem_THFC We need a 2nd Str Target-Man too. To lead when Kane is out. Or to play Kane as a #10 with him. I see a deadline day Austin bid.
kane,@Spurs2380 Kane may well get so disillusioned with lack of signings that he slaps in a transfer request. That would be interesting!
kane,@THFC_Spurs KANE he may be ABLE he feckin aint what a touch for a bug man #kanescomedygold
kane,@Teekosey I'm optimistic about Son. Looks like a great finisher and to have another goal threat may open up some space for Kane
kane,"@_Meredinho I just worry he could go either way 50/50,pretty much like Kane,hoping he has a most important 2nd season,need finished article"
kane,"@andygoldstein05 I'll go Kane in......one of Mata, Fellani or Young going the other way. 2nd Benzema for DDG........warm or freezing? Neymar"
kane,@arby_18 @NHL_Campbell remember that day Chevy traded Bogo and Kane... Wonder if history could repeat itself. A 2nd p for p trade..
kane,@benjiboodleboy and the fact you only have 10. Take it he's the missing 11th player behind Kane?
kane,@biggersthebomb Seems to me like the Spurs gotta be careful because once Kane's contract runs out he may leave
kane,@cartilagefree can Son and N'Jie give us what we need to supplement Kane until the January window?
kane,"@closetothegame Kane in EDM would be insane. If Kane went to MIN, MIN may finally be able to beat CHI in the playoffs"
kane,"@davemeasures True, but I don't think Kane wants to leave. He's young and living the dream. Why would he go to United, to come 4th not 5th?"
kane,@dobbospurs88 I reckon Kane will get off the mark on Sat then he'll be buzzing again c
kane,@fantasyleague @EwingCalvin Going to be at the Lane on Saturday and if he's not in the squad I'll be gutted... Kane needs help!
kane,@hfialkov Thanks. Any credibility to Kane interest with Huberdeau as centerpiece? Or shall I just wait until tomorrow?
kane,@hotspur423 as fans we should expect 6th and visible improvements in style. He will have to drop Kane for the cups now which is very sad.
kane,@james_sussex tbh I also wanted to have him and Kane gain a partnership in case we need it 1-0 down and need a 2nd striker. No better game.
kane,@juicysushi @ColinWaters @Inverted_FB @BenoitsSmartCar Kane gets hurt tomorrow. You really want Chadli/Son playing 99% of striker till May?
kane,@julesss_x0 maybe he will let us go 3rd period to get it fixed. Or Kane's class
kane,@leaham50 @_jaylawrence We started the window with 2 problem areas. Needing a 1st XI standard DM and a pacey ST as a Plan B/Back up to Kane.
kane,@mank56 @TottenhamFC93 @STurner2011 if we get pace into the side and support Kane more then things may turn out ok
kane,"@mattyd1984 Yeah would be. Think Kane will retire soon, so that may happen with those two. Still got 8 months till Mania so we'll see."
kane,@neilashton_ you red tops are so biased towards London clubs slagging Rooney off for not scoring then say Kane should be ENG 1st choice
kane,@nicktheyid61 he may be able to scrape by just with the midfield but if Kane has a difficult time or injury I don't see enough goals in us
kane,@pokeefe1 totally agree. After Levy's balls up with getting Berahino we may as well have used Ade as back up to Kane
kane,"@rocketrichman bizarre... Kane breaks a leg in training with England tomorrow, then what?"
kane,@russjohns8 @Slinger1970 @_LAPDOG  I've gotta admit I'm not too sure yet about Kane mysen... Got a lot to live up to after that 1st season
kane,"@ryanshoey Kane and bentaleb were always gonna breakthrough, too talented not to, Bentaleb should be 4th choice with class in front of him"
kane,"@simonhfootball Yep, Kolarov and Wilson are two I want in for sure. May even get shot of Eriksen as Kane isn't scoring."
kane,"@sloader300 What were Mason's 2 good chances? Kane's 2nd (was that the one creeated by Chadli, where he had 4 bodies to shoot through)?"
kane,@spuddy1878 it's always against no doubt Kane will end his drought on Saturday
kane,"@spursycob @realdealdanny we gambled that team would stay third all season, just like we gambled kane alone would get us through 1st games"
kane,@stumpyspurs Man Utd may be forced to go in for Kane or even Austin if they can't lure bigger stars to the club.
kane,"@takerman15 I never once thought, it would be Kane until the last hr. people starting it may be Kane."
kane,@thcoast @DanIrving95 take potential out of the equation is S.B. really a downgrade from Kane? i dont think so. his pace may B better suited
kane,"@tottenhamtalk1 Get him straight in the number 10 tomorrow night what you think? Son to Kane, Kane with the rabona pass to Son, Goal 2-0 Tot"
kane,@whoUthinkURiam Kane? And Aguero was surely better than Hazard maybe he gets 1st since he won the title

kane,Credit where it's due that is a good ball by Mason but I would say the ball is made by Kane's run. He'll score 2 in the 2nd half.
kane,"Damn.  My two fav Chicago athletes, Kane and D Rose, may be facing rape charges.  Hope neither is true...but if so...justice for the women."
kane,Do you think Kane needs to switch gimmicks again? Should Kane get one more run?  #WWE #SoFarBackSunday #SFBS http://t.co/fw1TSxeZ7J

kendrick,Why can't Kendrick rap on every song like he did Black Friday. Old Kendrick is better.
kendrick,Yo it's been 2 and a half weeks since Kendrick's Black Friday dropped and I still haven't fully understood all his lyrics yet...
kendrick,"if you think Kendrick's Black Friday was better than J. Cole's, you can block me now"
kendrick,Pink Friday set the standard for all Rap albums. If it wasn't for Nicki y'all wouldn't have them mediocre bitches like Kendrick and Drake.

kendrick,Em is better at painting a picture with his words.and thats just my opinion..cuz ppl view Kendrick's 1st album as a story..and I don't.
kendrick,FACT: if Kendrick made a song about crapping it would be 10x more influential than a Future song about slavery https://t.co/k6WXDJKkSH

kendrick,Kendrick in Black Friday &gt; J Cole in it
kendrick,Kendrick may have gotten all the critical acclaim... But that album ain't last past the first week from my understanding.
kendrick,"Kendrick's Black Friday on replay, gonna be that kind of day."
kendrick,Kendrick's To Pimp a Butterfly was at 1st (2) (p)IMP (a) (c)ATERPILAR.tupac.the last track on the album ends in a conversation between the 2
kendrick,Let August &amp; Kendrick get on the same track &amp; watch the world crack!... Slowly
kendrick,Like I heard so many people complain about Kendrick's flow on TPAB but loved Black Friday. When he used the same EXACT flows in that.

kendrick,So what do you think about Black Friday by Kendrick
kendrick,Someone said that they might snub Kendrick on all 11 nominations or he may get just 1. If that happens then it's clearly rigged.

niall,"I'm phone is going to died so goodnight i will be back tomorrow if i have time see you guys tomorrow goodnight to Harry,Niall,Liam, Louis"

niall,Why is everyone talking about Niall's bday it's not until the 13th ok I have 8 more days until I panic bc he's 22
niall,Why is no one talking about the fact that Niall's birthday is almost here. Or the fact the boys can drop the 5th album any day now
niall,"by tomorrow, my layout will hopefully consist of a selfie with Niall and otra fireworks fingers crossed people"
niall,do you know that moment when you stare at the sun and your eyes start to cry because it's so bright? that happens to me when i look at Niall

niall,I get to see the love of my life for the 4th time omgjsjsnznz NIALL
niall,niall's voice is just TOO GOOD this 5th album will kill me
nicki,@MileyCyrus I dreamed about katy perry dragging Nicki's back for you on sunday and it was very fatal. I hope it's gonna happen
nicki,"@Nicki_F @ThalesLives @scottedelman You may disagree Nicki, but the facts just don't support you. Nor does the vote by all of fandom."
nicki,@TMZ Miley may act and be the way she is but she is a good person. Nicki is the one looking for fights anywhere. Embarrassing...
nicki,"@itsbl0ndie I still think it was fake. I always thought Nicki to be the type to call you out on a random Tuesday, not at an awards show"
nicki,"@musicnews_shade azealia may not be the most famous rapper of all time but sadly, nicki's songs are in billboard for her physique not talent"
nicki,@rayshellbox Kasi nga diba may prejudice pa rin about black entertainers? Also Miley says that Nicki keeps pulling the race card--
nicki,"A no no, Kanye announces he's running for president, and nicki gets crazy with Miley all in the the same night.. It's Sunday wtf"
nicki,A woman called Nicki a wee bitch and spat because she sat down in front of her on the 11
nicki,"All Nicki said was ""what's good"" like c'mon now we get it she a bad bitch ok"
nicki,"And tomorrow Nicki is going to be seen as ""a raging angry black women"" for calling Miley out of something that she is GUILTY for"
nicki,Do you guys remember that not too long ago Nicki was like one of the most hated artist.. During her Pink Friday album
nicki,"I think Nicki made an ass out of herself last night. 1st you call the VMA's racist, 2nd then you perform and accept an award at the VMA's"
nicki,I'm over here tryna do this work before classes start tomorrow and Nicki is being the shady bitch queen she is and I just lost all focus
nicki,"If Nicki didn't have her ass, she'd be shorter when she sat down."
nicki,If you think Nicki's ass is more than 1/8th real you are fuuucked
nicki,Kanye and Nicki are the reason they may have to do away with award shows. YOU say it's about artists but you two always make it about YOU.
nicki,"Literally 1st time I've ever watched the #VMAs. Miley called Nicki out on her CRAP, and I respect that. #sorrynotsorry #suckitupnicki"
nicki,"Miley is the 8th most hated person in America, idk why y'all are acting like Nicki gets more hate than Miley"
nicki,Nicki dead ass sat in our fAces and lied to us about meek. bye http://t.co/XTK1x0URvo
nicki,Nicki's butt is just too big like c'mon that's not even fun anymore like
nicki,Why is Nicki always calling someone out on stage .. Bitch looks so trashy while Miley just sat there and took what she said with class
nicki,Yall act like Nicki really Finna mess up Taylor's moment ............for the 2nd time again. #VMAs
nicki,i want mildew clitoris off my tl i dont want her anywhere near nicki i dont want to see her rat ass ever again launch her into the sun
nicki,"i'm tweeting this for the 2nd time, nicki needs to realize that people don't buy her music NOT BECAUSE SHE ISN'T ""SKINNY AND WHITE""+"
nicki,miley.. you better watch out for nicki backstage she may throw hands
nicki,tbh if tomorrow ppl start going after Nicki for what she said im gonna be pissed
nicki,"(Nicki chuckled.) So, you just got here in Sun City? https://t.co/AIrLJlok7G"
nicki,*sends bae video of drake looking at nicki like she the sun* why u dont look at me like that
nicki,"1. Drake  2,3,4 is Sean, Kendrick, Cole whatever u want the order to be   5. no idea who in that 5th spot...Nicki? I'll leave that to y'all"
nicki,1st of all...why didn't Meek help Nicki to the stage. I would have cussed him to filth
nicki,"1st time I've watched the vmas in years .. What, did Nicki just...."
nicki,1st: Taylor and Avril 2nd: Taylor and Nicki 3rd: Taylor and Katy????  Hahahaahhahahhh.. maybe its the start of the new beginning???
nicki,"2nd one is a trinidadian headdress i believe, which is nicki's home country. im silent on the other 3 tho https://t.co/0udsnLtBeC"
nicki,"5SOS won, Taylor &amp; Nicki had a duet, Nicki looked like she wanted to beat the crap out of Miley. Waking up to this, Monday is good for once!"
nicki,@Ashley_Chenelle is she cussing out Nicki? I may need to learn how to work this tv
nicki,"@DaRealAmberRose hey amber are you free November 14th. I asked Nicki but her best friend told me she has a boyfriend, that's clear."
nicki,@DaRealKhefner: When Nicki see Miley Sunday: https://t.co/NF2F3AFZOF   the accuracy
nicki,@ERINJEEN you may dress like nicki and amelia may dress like miley
nicki,"@GrilledCamwich you're missing the whole point onto what Nicki was trying to say. it may be mtv wasn't racist, but many times"
nicki,"@HighOnVibe Depends what she said though, Nicki may have had a reason to start! Have you seen the video?"
nicki,@LeilaJoldusic Lmaooo but the Nicki controversy may get people talking
nicki,@Minajlb @SOFTXSHUG but Nicki dissed her first n threw the 1st shots all d while copying her
nicki,@NICKIMINAJ sat here and rewatched Nicki's opening and that is all for tonight
nicki,"@NicoletteKelley Set a reminder: October 6. Get ready to join the celebration around #AllDayBreakfast, Nicki!"
nicki,@OnikaThot Nicki was trying to or the producers told her to discredit Mariah there and Mariah sat her bc she's still more successful
nicki,"@SarahSahadinCBB You can always meet them on the Friday shakedown as Nicki said that'd be better, so it probably will be for the others! ;)"
nicki,"@TMZLive @MTVNews Miley &amp; Nicki staged it. Not only did NM break a smile, from the 2nd c-angle Miley says ""what"", before Nicki states topic"
nicki,"@ayahmdee13 I think her and Nicki opened the show. But never got to watch it. And, I think I may have been watching the backstage haha"
nicki,@bieberloundon i feel like Nicki may have been joking but miley may not have known. Nicki is so vocal on twitter i feel like she
nicki,"@dquintia_ Nicki's role may be essential, but it is not a role to defend publicly. Do you get what I mean?"
nicki,"@eh_kees perception is 9/10th of reality. Because we perceive Meek as ""not good enough"" for Nicki. His support looks like he is star struck"
nicki,@garcia_syanne are you going over auntie nicki's tomorrow?
nicki,"@gatheringcopal Lol It just seems like Nicki like to really take things to the 3rd nipple. Miley, Mariah, Kim, Taylor, list goes on"
nicki,@highsociety_k @teamkimlisa account to Kims MOTHER Kim was born 1976 she turned 39 July 11. Nicki will be 33 in 4 months. My accuracy &gt; urs
nicki,@leslimorale5 That's like saying Kim never actually said Nicki's name in Black Friday. You know who was the target.
nicki,@naidej_ I'll tell you more tomorrow but Miley was throwing shade at Nicki and Nicki just called her out
nicki,"@nycki96 @tigrayrocks WE aren't too far apart, Nicki. In fact, we may be at the same point. I don't remember if I stopped at 11 or 12."
nicki,@vertivangogh I may watch them just to see why people are saying Nicki called out Miley lol. That was probably deserved.
nicki,@zackrorz but people hated way before then tbh and I think it may have been directed at lil' Kim other than Iggy because Nicki denied later
nicki,"All he said is that it was funny, and weren't you up Nicki's ass in July? https://t.co/MnZZR01bDP"
nicki,All the talk will be about Nicki and Miley tomorrow. Nothing else has been talk worthy. #VMAs
nicki,Alone at a McDonald's. Few vestibules away people are talking about Mar's presidency run while the other table talks about Nicki's VMA feud.
nicki,"And that Nicki and Miley ""beef"" looked toooo staged, Nicki smiled, Miley response was too instant (like she been practisin it).. c'mon MTV"
nicki,Ask a kid watching the #VMAs where they were when Nicki called Miley out...now ask them what happen Nov 22 1963 (crickets). #SoSad
nicki,Azealia Banks may find herself in another hot situation after she involved herself in the Miley Cyrus and Nicki... http://t.co/BUZ6UjCoCD
nicki,"Basically my Sunday-Monday transition   ""@en_jajaja: Nicki: thank you to my pastor Nicki: SO BITCH YOU WAS TALKIN MAD SHIT WHAT UP W THAT"""
nicki,"Be prepared to listen about Nicki and Miley tomorrow at school, or maybe Kanye"
nicki,Because Nicki actually looked up to Kim but Kim came at her for no reason?? Why argue with someone you idolized? https://t.co/LjIu2xxZiL
nicki,Boohoo Miley called Nicki unpolite KIM CALLED HER EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN just admit NICKI KNOW WHO TO TRY
nicki,Boy...Kenryn just asked me if Nicki goin march in a second line...lmaoo
nicki,"But Miley, what IS good? I think Nicki needs an answer on her desk by tomorrow morning if you wanna keep ya scalp."
nicki,"Can't wait to see the lame ass ""think pieces"" about how Nicki is ""an angry black woman"" and how she was ""mean"" to Miley tomorrow"
nicki,Damn.... Miley Cyrus needs to watch it that bitch is gonna get sat on and crushed by Nicki.
nicki,Hi my name iSSk Nicki and itsSSKS tHFfe firSSKT day of sShckhool - me in my new retainer tomorrow
nicki,"I do have some complaints about this this beautiful Sunday night. First, miley handled that well. Nicki should be... http://t.co/4pAjjyTGhd"
nicki,"I don't get too riled up, because Nicki may be dancing with Miley onstage at the next awards show. #VMAs"
nicki,I don't think Nicki's pregnant. Stomach was flat again in the side view. Think she was just sticking her butt out in the 1st pic.
nicki,I feel like I'm in 3rd grade again watching the VMAs.   Kanye is to Trump as Nicki is to Miley.
nicki,I feel like she's trying to do a Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded thing like Nicki but it's literally just Flaming Lips album rejects.
nicki,I get that marriage equality probably isn't an issue that directly affects Nicki so she may focus on it less...
nicki,I just realized today is Sunday y'all Nicki and Kanye were preachin to the choir
nicki,I like Meek Mills when he raps because he talks like a handicapped 4th grader...how do he and Nicki hold conversations???
nicki,I like to avoid my Monday's like Miley avoided Nicki at the VMAs
nicki,I may even include a rendition of Nicki's 'death stare' she shot at Miley last night
nicki,"I may joke, but Nicki's totally valid points about a racist system will be forgotten again because of a white woman's comments"
nicki,I remember when haterade by Nicki pharrell and Gucci was my ringtone in the 4th grade
nicki,"I start school tomorrow and I'm here watching Kanye rant, Miley and Nicki go at it and Tori Kelly blow the roof out of the #VMAs"
nicki,I still think they should have let Nicki continue what she was going to say rather then cut her off cuz it may hurt Miley's feelings
nicki,"I still would like a Nicki follow, but if she followed me, she'd just be a flop that followed me.  https://t.co/DhxDzeUZog"
nicki,"I think sure Nicki may have been joking though, if she had real beef I feel like it would be a lil scarier."
nicki,I thought this may have been entertaining after nicki's moment but it's actually very painful
nicki,I was just stalking Nicki's IG and now I have to work out for 18 hours tomorrow
nicki,I wish Nicki would have flew across the stage and slapped that hoe !  https://t.co/D9dtRKeZji
nicki,I wonder if they'll cut out Nicki calling Miley out when they air it again tomorrow
nicki,"I'm a bit annoyed about what miley said about nicki. Taylor started the pop star against pop star war, nicki didn't even sat her name"
nicki,I'm at work for 14.5 hours tomorrow lmao someone make me go to bed and stop reading articles about nicki
nicki,I'm literally nervous for what Kanye may say tonight...he more of a loose cannon than Nicki
nicki,If I rise tomorrow and there's no sign of 1) Zayn throwing a public tantrum or 2) Nicki taking over the world then I'm checking out of life
nicki,If the weeknd doesn't clear up the rumors about him disliking black women tomorrow I might have to pull a kayne on him then pull a Nicki
nicki,It looks like Nicki may be very small in person. Well small with a big butt lol.
nicki,It's Monday and I just need to know the status of this Nicki and Miley beef...
nicki,Just watched how Nicki called out bitch Miley Cyrus on stage at the #VMAs. May the one who has the biggest ass wins.
nicki,K. I'm just already done with everyone. I don't think I'll be talking to anyone tomorrow. I'm so close to havin my own Nicki moment...
nicki,Like Miley said she didn't look into everything but she thought Nicki may have been subbing her but she didn't know for sure. Her words.
nicki,Lol watch how the media paints Nicki as an angry black woman tomorrow morning and miley as the victim #bye
nicki,"Lol. You can still watch, Nicki asked Miley what's good and called her a bitch (most interesting part of the show) https://t.co/tCIdK88LtI"
nicki,Meek Mill dissed Future too? Nicki may as well start giving him an allowance cause it's all over.
nicki,Meek about to have a 2nd wave coming from twitter bc Nicki came harder without a song haha
nicki,Miley better pick up the Hannah Montana wig again because that may be the only she'll hide from Nicki. #VMAs2015
nicki,Miley was a child actor.I'm sure most of the net worth is from the Hannah Montana days.C'mon now. Don't play Nicki.  https://t.co/ovhZyCwYOy
nicki,More like Taylor wants to stay the hell away from Miley bc she saw how Nicki dragged her Sunday. https://t.co/Xo7KkQWeSS
nicki,NYFW doesn't begin until Thursday. Y'all gonna get Nicki inadvertently cursed out cz mfs gonna think she stayed home.
nicki,Nicki &amp; Tay may be friends but I'm still not a fan like was Nicki for real about Miley this is too much for my emotions Im so confused #VMAs
nicki,Nicki Minaj Confronts Miley Cyrus Live on Stage at the VMA's. Sunday night Nicki called Miley out in a way that... http://t.co/NJ6dJO7HZ8
nicki,Nicki and Miley left nothing to the imagination at Sunday night's VMA's.
nicki,"Nicki carried Taylor so much in that performance, tomorrow she's going to need a Nicki massage. #VMAs"
nicki,Nicki dead hasn't sat in an audience of an award show (besides BET) in awhile. She can't be bothered with those YTs.
nicki,Nicki does not have the time to be shady she will deadass drop the tea on ya lap and let you get a 3rd degree burn
nicki,"Nicki has no class? Mf got a fish in his avi. You get off to the smell of fish right? C'mon bitch step ya dick up, TWEET @ ME. @dmart4511"
nicki,"Nicki is always feuding with somebody. Lil Kim, Mariah Carey, Iggy Azalea, Taylor Swift, now Miley Cyrus... I like her but c'mon"
nicki,Nicki is gonna open with trini dem girls on the pinkprint tour in south africa on the 2nd leg
nicki,Nicki just gave this pastor a shout out but didn't attend Sunday school last Sunday. Man please.
nicki,"Nicki may be thinking it's better to confront her, as other people will think they can try it too. Which is true. Just my opinion."
nicki,Nicki may have called Miley out but Miley's messages tonight were much more powerful than any performance at the VMAs
nicki,Nicki may have forgiven Taylor... but I still think she's corny for what she did.
nicki,"Nicki may look Hollywood, but you hear every bit of New York when she opens her mouth."
nicki,Nicki may need a wardrobe change if she plans on winning anything else tonight. #VMAs
nicki,Nicki went from I want to thank my Pastor to cursing at Miley. That may beat what Kanye did to Taylor Swift.
nicki,Nicki's pastor is mad af right now. And it's Sunday smh
nicki,No really Nicki may have been the only black female artist we saw tonight
nicki,Not if nicki is gone be in it  https://t.co/bftjyZZFFz

zayn,@BasicallyPayne_ @Real_Liam_Payne ok... First thing first.. U gotta know the statement wasn't made by Zayn but management and the sun
zayn,@ElleDevin @musicnews_shade @zaynmalik that's why Pierrie and Zayn are so pale. They haven't been seeing the sun bc they've been so shady
